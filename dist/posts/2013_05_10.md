  <h1>Grunt</h1>
<p>Why use Grunt?
The Grunt ecosystem is huge and it&#x27;s growing every day. With literally
hundreds of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to automate just
about anything with a minimum of effort. If someone hasn&#x27;t already
built what you need, authoring and publishing your own Grunt plugin to
npm is a breeze.</p>
